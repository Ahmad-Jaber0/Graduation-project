# Dynamic Website Management
â€¢	Built a dynamic editor page, allowing site moderators to enter course page data easily with tools similar to Microsoft Word. Implemented a dynamic website management system that enables the easy addition, editing, and deletion of courses and quizzes without the need for coding and advanced course editing skills.  
# Helper System
Our intelligent feature recommends the most suitable starting chapters for each learner based on their current understanding and levels, ensuring a personalized learning experience.
# Recommender System
We created a content-based recommender system that suggests courses aligning with the learner's preferences, previous knowledge, and learning style, making learning more efficient and tailored.
